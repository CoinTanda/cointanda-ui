  "Frequently Asked Questions": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "What is CoinTanda faq": "CoinTanda is a social saving platform. By joining a group of people called a Tanda, you can win money by investing cryptocoins which generate interest.",
  "What do I need to participate faq": "You need some cryptocoins, for this first version: DOC(Dollar on Chain). You also need a DeFi wallet such as Liquality, Nifty or Metamask in which your coins are stored. You will also need this wallet to register for CoinTanda, under 9 and 10 we will explain how to download and set up your wallet.",
  "Do I have to entrust my money to you faq": "No. We never hold the private keys to your coins, you are always in full control of them. CoinTanda is based on smart contracts and is fully decentralized.",
  "What is a provably fair raffle faq": "In traditional gambling, the bank would always win. It is impossible to check if it was cheating or not. In a blockchain-based raffle like CoinTanda, you are in control. The algorithm by which the winner gets selected is disclosed and can be checked by everyone. You can therefore be sure that the raffle operator will not cheat you and that every participant has a fair chance to win.",
  "Where does the interest come from faq1": "CoinTanda cooperates with decentralized lending platforms which provide traders with the money they need to operate their business. Traders can make more profits if they work with higher amounts, so they borrow money for which they pay an interest.",
  "Where does the interest come from faq2": "In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) all these operations between traders, lenders and lending platforms are managed by smart contracts. No humans or companies act as custodians who control other people’s money.",
  "What are smart contracts faq1": "A smart contract is a piece of software that works a bit like a vending machine. You insert the required amount of cryptocoins, and the smart contract will automatically deliver what is defined by its software code. A smart contract contains all the rules and penalties between the contract parties, and it also enforces them.",
  "What are smart contracts faq2": "In our case, the smart contract defines the relations between you, the lending platform that generates the interest and CoinTanda. Your coins will not be managed by a human, but by the smart contract.",
  "Are smart contracts safe faq1": "Smart contracts are definitely more trustworthy than human beings, as they cannot cheat you or run away with your money. Theoretically every piece of software can be hacked, but smart contracts are open source and audited.",
  "Are smart contracts safe faq2": "Open source software can be checked and corrected by anyone who has the right skills, which makes it much more secure than proprietary software, which can only be checked by the company that produces it.",
  "Are smart contracts safe faq3": "Furthermore, our smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by a neutral company which is specialized on this. We can therefore assure you that investing your money in CoinTanda is as safe as it can be.",
  "What are RSK smart contracts faq1": "CoinTanda works with smart contracts by RSK (also known as Rootstock) which run on top of the Bitcoin  lockchain. As the Bitcoin blockchain has far more computing power than any other, it makes RSK smart contracts much more secure than any other. RSK smart contracts also have much lower transaction fees than e.g. Ethereum.",
  "What are RSK smart contracts faq2": "The only small downside is that you cannot put Bitcoins in a smart contract directly, you have to convert them into so called Smart Bitcoins (short: RBTC). You can always exchange your Smart Bitcoins back into Bitcoin, and as both are linked 1 to 1 (1 RBTC = 1 BTC), so you don‘t need to fear to miss a Bitcoin bull run.",
